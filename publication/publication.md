## Analyzing multivariate data in mvpa

The following section is intended to show, how the mvpa package can be used to analyze multivariate dataset by means of the multivariate pattern analysis approach. For this purpose, we reproduce the tables and plots from the mvpa manuscript, using the HOMA-IR dataset. However, for how to interpret the plots and obtained results we refer to the manuscript. 

The HOMA-IR dataset is contained in the R package and can be loaded, using the following command:

```R
library(mvpa)
mvpa::HOMA_IR
```

### The guides  

We offer a step-by-step guide for the [R version](publication/R-script.md) and the [R shiny app](publication/shiny-workflow).
